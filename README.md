# Heart Rate Failure Detection - Machine Learning
Heart Rate Failure Detection Machine Learning Models.

Download the trained models for the [release](https://github.com/khushalbhardwaj-0111/heart_failure_prediction/releases) section.

This is a part of my machine learning projects made after watching the [Machine Learning Tutorial](https://youtu.be/NWONeJKn6kc) on YouTube by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) by Ayush Singh.
